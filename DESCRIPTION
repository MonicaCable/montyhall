Description: This package plays the game from The Monty Hall Problem.
	In this game, a contestant is faced with three doors. One door
	hides a car, which they can win if they choose the car door.The
	other doors hide goats, indicating a loss of the game. The
	contestant first chooses a door, then the game host reveals one of 
	the goat doors. The contestant now has to choose whether they want
	to stay with their original door and hope that it was the winning
	car door, or switch to the other unopened door and hope that that
	door hides the car. This function plays the game several times to
	demonstrate statistically which strategy is more likely to win:
	staying or switching.
